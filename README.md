# code-test-pizza-app
Finalize a Single Page Pizza App using JS, jQuery, AJAX, PHP and SESSION data

/* *************************************************************************
 * Welcome to the SwipeTrack PIZZA PIZZA code exercise.  We'd like to get to
 * know your skillset and style.  We have this "application", designed to
 * let a user create a list of the toppings they want on their pizza.  We
 * store this list on the backend in case the user leaves and returns to the
 * site.  Normally this would be done in a database, but for this exercise
 * we are using a PHP session.
 * 
 * There is one problem -- it doesn't allow the user to remove a topping if
 * they change their mind.  We'd like you to put that functionality in.
 * We would prefer you stick to AJAX so that the imaginary rest of the
 * application interface does not have to be reloaded.  Aside from that,
 * you have complete creative freedom.
 * 
 * If you have any questions, need any help or explanation of any of the
 * code below, please don't hesitate to contact tammy@swipetrack.com
